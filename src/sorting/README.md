# Sorting 

## Motivation

On March 1st, 2023, Leetcode featured problem number 912 "Sort an Array" as its daily challenge. I attempted to implement Quick Sort using various pivot selection strategies such as always selecting the right-most pivot, 3-way partitioning, etc. However, there was always a worst-case test set that led to a time complexity of O(N^2) and resulted in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.

On the other hand, I had no issues with Heap Sort and Merge Sort, at least for the test cases in Leetcode. 

Sorting is one of the most fundamental routines in Computer Science and Information Technology, and I created this project to practice and thoroughly examine these types of algorithms.

### Merge Sort
On March 11th, 2023, I reached a personal milestone on Leetcode by solving problem number 23, "Merge k Sorted Lists", marking my 100th consecutive day of completing daily challenges on this platform. I find the concept of merge sort and related algorithms fascinating, and I plan to devote more time to honing my skills in this area through further practice.
