# EDIT DISTANCE
This project is about algorithms that can find the edit distance between two text strings. This is the number of edit operations needed to transform one string into another. If the edit operations include substitution, insertion, or deletion, then it is called the Levenshtein distance.

One of the main reasons I created this project is because today (February 26, 2023), Leetcode is using problem number 72 "Edit Distance" as its daily challenge. It reminds me of my doctoral and postdoctoral work. Today, I used the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. I created this project to further review and implement algorithms to find the edit distance between text strings.
